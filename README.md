# Two tier app deployment methods using Docker, Docker-Compose, Kubernetes, helm and EKS

We have a flask app where you can input data in textbox which will get stored in the sql database and get displayed on frontend.

## 5 part series
[Part 1](docs/Part1-DockerDeployment.md): Understanding and deploying applications using Docker and Docker Compose.

[Part 2](docs/Part2-KubernetesCluster.md): Exploring Kubernetes fundamental architecture and setting up a cluster on EC2 using kubeadm.

[Part 3](/docs/Part3-KubernetesDeployment): Deploying containerized applications on the Kubernetes cluster.

[Part 4](/docs/Part4-helm.md): Learning Helm and deploying applications using Helm templates.

[Part 5](/docs/Part5-EKSDeployment.md): Setting up and deploying applications on an EKS cluster.

Using git to push every part after completion will be very helpful for github contribution 

Please Note: There will be a minimal cost of $2-10 for EC2 usage, as we will need at least a t2.medium instance. stop the instances once your daily hands on is done, terminate on finishing the project.
